## What is it?

It's a rebuild of [spotify-unwrapped](https://github.com/desruc/spotify-unwrapped) using Next.js 13. I wanted to try out the new features and figured what better way than to convert an old project.

Unwrapped leverages the Spotify API to give you a breakdown of your top artists, albums, tracks, and genres in three different date ranges.
